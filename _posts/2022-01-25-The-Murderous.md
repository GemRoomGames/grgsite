# The Wreck Of The Murderous

_DEATH beckons a warband of viking cats to glory, but their journey is interrupted by a storm that runs their vessel aground on a dark and mysterious island. Their cloaked companion acts as though this is a mere detour on their jounrey to face down the canine conjurers that would see an end to the Age of Beasts!_

## Before The Wreck of The Murderous

Be sure to discuss tone and comfort levels to ensure that everyone can enjoy an evening of gleeful ultaviolence as discussed in the Tone section of the book (This is available in the sneak peak which can be found at https://gemroomgames.itch.io)

Let the players introduce their peerless warrior cats and who they were before DEATH beckoned them to glorious ruin.

## The Beach

+ DEATH and the cat warband recover from a lost battle at sea
+ Hear the plutonian waves pounding against the shore
+ Taste the saltwater and sand in their mouths as they awaken
+ See driftwood, black sand, inquisitive but mostly harmless seagull folk, seaweed
+ Smell dead fish, salt, bracing cold wind
+ Their vessel has run aground in a nearby cove along the black sand
+ To the NW, a ruined city overrun with foliage along ruined roads
+ To the NE, an obelisk looms over a high cliff

### What Can Kill You Here

**Crabs** - 2d6 Armored, hidden under the sand, only giving themselves away through small bubbles in the muck, eviscerate with huge claws.

> Cats who do not employ Viciousness when attacking armored foes will give DEATH an extra d6 to roll!

**Gangs of Seagull Scavengers** - 1d8+1d6, fight in huge swarms, will attempt to divest The Murderous of its treasures

### The Hull of The Murderous

Much cargo was lost, the ship is beyond repair without time, materials, and an expert shipwright.

Exploring The Murderous, each cat will find a personal posession of their choosing which reflects their past as well as a sack of gold and a sealed jar of catnip.
