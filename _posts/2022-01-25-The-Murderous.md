# The Wreck Of The Murderous
> An Adventure for 9 Lives to Valhalla

_DEATH beckons a warband of viking cats to glory, but their journey is interrupted by a storm that runs their vessel aground on a dark and mysterious island. Their cloaked companion acts as though this is a mere detour on their jounrey to face down the canine conjurers that would see an end to the Age of Beasts!_

> Note: The Wreck of the Murderous is in development, and additional sections will be added and updated over the next week. This was written live on stream and published early as an experiment, but until we both have an opportunity to write, edit, and possibly add artwork it should be considered more "GM Prep" than a proper adventure. Follow @gemroomgames on twitter for updates as The Wreck Of The Murderous takes shape!

## Before The Wreck of The Murderous

Be sure to discuss tone and comfort levels to ensure that everyone can enjoy an evening of gleeful ultaviolence as discussed in the Tone section of the book (This is available in the sneak peak which can be found at https://gemroomgames.itch.io)

Let the players introduce their peerless warrior cats and who they were before DEATH beckoned them to glorious ruin.

## The Beach

+ DEATH and the cat warband recover from a lost battle at sea
+ **Hear** the plutonian waves pounding against the shore
+ **Taste** the saltwater and sand in their mouths as they awaken
+ **See** driftwood, black sand, inquisitive but mostly harmless seagull folk, seaweed
+ **Smell** dead fish, salt, bracing cold wind
+ Their vessel has run aground in a nearby cove along the black sand
+ To the NW, a ruined city overrun with foliage along ruined roads
+ To the NE, an obelisk looms over a high cliff

### What Can Kill You Here

**Crabs** - 2d6 Armored, hidden under the sand, only giving themselves away through small bubbles in the muck, eviscerate with huge claws.

> Cats who do not employ Viciousness when attacking armored foes will give DEATH an extra d6 to roll!

**Gangs of Seagull Scavengers** - 1d8+1d6, fight in huge swarms, will attempt to divest The Murderous of its treasures

### The Hull of The Murderous

Much cargo was lost, the ship is beyond repair without time, materials, and an expert shipwright.

Exploring The Murderous, each cat will find a personal posession of their choosing which reflects their past as well as a sack of gold and a sealed jar of catnip.

## The Ruined City

+ As you approach, cracked asphalt and shards of glass emerge from the earth. Slowly roads begin to coalesce as you approach the city limits.
+ Doorways loom and the stairs to them are chest high. This city was built for giants. All ruined, now.
+ **feel** eyes upon you from hidden figures at the windows above
+ **see** paper drifting in the wind, blind alleys, shuffling folk who don't want trouble
+ **hear** fighting on other streets, wind howling down the road, a priest roaring the glory of lions

### What Can Kill You Here
**Cliques** of frogs, ducks, rats, raccoons, and dogs in ritual leathers, military surplus, absurd formalwear, rockstar attire, futuristic plastics, or stark naked. They call themselves things like The 5th Street Fangs, The Mendicants, Death's Chosen, Maneaters, or The Pretty Lads. They travel in packs of 4 to 8 and should usually get 2d6 to roll. Particularly worthy clique members are Tricky. They all act like they aren't scared of Brunhilde.

**Brunhilde** the Coyote Queen of The Ruined City. Giant, rolls 2d8. She wears a crown of hammered iron. Her hide has scarred over the weapons left in her by cliques who failed to bring her down. The smart ones run if they know what's good for them. Has no particular grievance against cats but will attack if anything short of utmost respect is paid in her presence.

### Amelia, Priestess of Leo
Following the sound of preaching will lead to a priestess of Leo in the maze of ancient streets. She dresses in clanking iron emblazoned with the sun. She will celebrate your quest at DEATH's side and laugh at her own jokes. If you accept her hospitality and stay for mead, she will speak of a crystalized human skull where dogs mine for marrow among the bones.

If you have Sacks of Gold, A Coward's Soul, or A Caged Mantis she will offer her Spirit Lantern, the Paw of a Living Saint, or a Silver Bowl.
